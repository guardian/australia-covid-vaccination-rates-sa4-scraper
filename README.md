This is a PDF scraper for the Australian government's [geographic vaccination rates PDFs](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-vaccination-geographic-vaccination-rates-2-august-2021).

Camelot is very good for extracting tables from PDFs but requires some non-python dependencies, see [here](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install.html).
